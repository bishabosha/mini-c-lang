[ ] tac
    [ ] Normal form of function application using recursion
        [ ] Return multiple lists from `parseCAst.statements` - One for each
            scope
        [ ] Add environment field to block and function
        [ ] Definition of func should be in scope for applications,
            [ ] whole block must be examined first (bearing in mind forward
                declarations) 
    [ ] variables to be assigned at most once?
[ ] run tac
[ ] possible solution to global stack in mycc is to have a map that for
    each build process can allot a new bucket.
[ ] use node to make --C build server and replace main in Parser.scala
    [ ] or try to send C callbacks to scala
[ ] specialised form of CAst to reduce match time
[ ] bitset for used temp registers
[ ] Type check as an interpreter step
[ ] Need to encode in the current frame an id for each variable or temporary
    so that its current register can be recorded
[ ] global variable name conflicts please remove
